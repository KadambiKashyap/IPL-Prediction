# IPL Prediction

---

This repository contains code for predicting IPL match outcomes using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to predict match results based on historical data.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. By leveraging historical match data and relevant features, the goal is to create a model that can provide insights into the potential winners of upcoming matches, aiding in decision-making for stakeholders such as team managers, fans, and betting enthusiasts.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather historical IPL match data, including match statistics, team performance metrics, player information, and venue details. Preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the raw data to enhance predictive power. This may include creating new variables, aggregating statistics, and incorporating contextual information such as player form, team dynamics, and match conditions.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train a Ridge regression model using the preprocessed data. Perform hyperparameter tuning using Randomized Search Cross Validation to optimize model performance. Evaluate the model using standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

4. **Model Deployment:** Save the trained model using joblib for future use in making predictions on new data.

## Results

The Ridge regression model demonstrates promising performance in predicting the total runs scored by a team in an IPL match. By leveraging historical match data and advanced machine learning techniques, the model achieves competitive accuracy and provides valuable insights into match outcomes. Stakeholders can use the predictions generated by the model to make informed decisions, enhance strategic planning, and gain a competitive edge in IPL match predictions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the IPL prediction project showcases the potential of machine learning in sports analytics, particularly in forecasting match outcomes and gaining insights into team performance dynamics. By leveraging historical data and advanced modeling techniques, the project demonstrates the feasibility of predicting IPL match results with reasonable accuracy. Future iterations of the project may explore additional features, ensemble methods, and real-time data integration to further enhance predictive performance and usability.
